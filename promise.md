# Promise

In JavaScript, a Promise is an object that will produce a single value some time in the future. If the promise is successful, it will produce a resolved value, but if something goes wrong then it will produce a reason why the promise failed

MDN: Promise is an object representing an eventual completion or failure of an async operation
